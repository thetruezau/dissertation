Mechanisations in relation with the formalisations on the paper.
\begin{itemize}
\item Some ideas for the metatheory formalised come from attemps of mechanisations.
  
\item The metatheory mechanised does not correspond exactly to the formalised in the literature.
  \subitem An example: the polymorphic definition for system  $\LamM$.
\end{itemize}

On the world of mechanising metatheory.
\begin{itemize}
\item Why use a outdated library for mechanising binders? What about \textit{Autosubst 2}?
\item Obstacles on the mechanisation of a non standard substitution operation.
\item SSreflect style proofs for \textit{Rocq Prover}.
\item Could there be more automation?  
\end{itemize}

Further work?
\begin{itemize}
\item Because of the modularity and of the \textit{Autosubst} library we have the facility to enrich our typing systems (ex: SystemF?).
