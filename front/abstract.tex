This dissertation details the mechanisation within the \textit{Rocq Prover} of a multiary $\Lam$-calculus (system $\LamM$) and associated metatheory.
We are motivated by the necessity for computer verification of metatheoretical proofs - which are often lengthy and prone to human error in manual treatments - and by the interest to extend the Curry-Howard isomorphism to calculi whose typing rules are inspired by the sequent calculus.
Our development uses a de~Bruijn representation to mechanise terms and uses the \textit{Autosubst} library to define the desired capture-avoiding substitution operations.
The formalised system $\LamM$ includes its reduction rules, typing system and core theorems like subject reduction.
A major contribution was the study of its canonical subsystem, its isomorphism with the simply typed $\Lam$-calculus and a conservativeness result.
Curiously, by formalising the isomorphism with the $\Lam$-calculus, we were able to derive the confluence for $\LamM$.
This work presents a novel mechanisation of this metatheory and details the rigorous methodology implemented.
